/**
 * Each line contains an employee name, a salary (in Rs. thousands per month),
 * the name of the company, and the name of the manager of that employee - all
 * separated by commas. You may assume that employee name, company name, and
 * manager name do not contain any commas, and that salary is an integer. The
 * special manager name NOBODY indicates that this employee does not have a
 * manager (and is hence the CEO of the company). You can assume that there is
 * only one CEO in each company.
 * 
 * Currently, the existing program reads the input and creates an
 * ArrayList<String> from the lines of input. Then it calls a method processData
 * on this ArrayList, and prints the returned data to the output file.
 * Unfortunately, processData currently does not do anything useful - it just
 * returns an empty `Map.
 * 
 * You have to modify processData to compute the minimum salary of any employee
 * in each company. Thus, processData will return a Map that maps each company
 * name to the minimum salary in that company. In other words, the map will
 * contain each company name as a key, and the minimum salary in that company as
 * the value for that entry.
